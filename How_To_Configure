. Apply the patch, being sure you do all steps:
 
1. Launch the patch
 2. Select your version (x86 or x64)
 3. When asked, locate and select the right client .exe file (x86 -> WoW.exe / x64 -> WoW-64.exe)
 4. As patcher window shows, "click the Arctium logo to apply the patch". You'll see some numbers at the right side of the patcher's window
 
. Open the file "WTF/Config.wtf" with any text editor (windows notepad, as example) and add the next line at the end (it you haven't done before): SET realmlist "127.0.0.1"
 


As said, the file is "Config.wtf" and it's located into the "WTF" subfolder, into your game folder
 
. Save the file with the new line
 
. Launch the updated servers from Craigy's repack (you'll have 2 console windows: The one for realm/authentication server and the one for the world/gameplay server)
 
. Launch the patched wow client (WoW_Patched.exe or WoW-64_Patched.exe)
 
. Login at game using default account (user/password: admin@admin / admin)
